## To deploy

Push changes to the `gh-pages` branch, to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## To Run locally

To run locally, we need to use a local web server, for the ajax requests to work when loading Vue.

Express is a simple web server that doesn't take much setup:

* `npm install express`
* `node -e "require('express')().use(require('express').static(__dirname, {index:'index.html'})).listen(8181)"`
